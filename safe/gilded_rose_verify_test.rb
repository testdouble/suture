  # This test verifies that when we play back what we just recorded against
  # the very same method, we get the same results. This ensures nothing is
  # being lost in persisting/extracting or comparing the items
  #
  # To run this test in isolation:
  #  bundle exec rake safe TESTOPTS="--name=test_gilded_rose_old"
  #
  def test_gilded_rose_old
    Suture.verify(:gilded_rose, {

  # This test verifies that @jimweirich's published solution to the Gilded Rose
  #   kata behaves the same way as the original code path. It will start by
  #   recording the original code then verify the recorded entries against the
  #   new code
  #
  # In this case we set `fail_fast` to false, because if we'd been using this
  #   Suture.verify to check our progress during a refactor, we'd want to see the
  #   total numbers of passed/failed, not just the first failure.
